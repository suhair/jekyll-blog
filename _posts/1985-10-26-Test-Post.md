Key mapping
===========

It is the process of mapping a sequence of keystrokes to mean a different, usually complex sequence of keystrokes.
Except for the <F1> key, other function keys are not mapped by default in Vim and they are good candidates for key mapping.

Issue the following to create our first key map

:map <F2> GoDate:

The above command maps the F2 function key to the following steps of instructions

1. Go the end of the file (G)
2. Insert a blank line below the end of the file and go to insert mode (o)
3. Type the text Date:

Let's expand on the previous command and let the vim insert the datetime string after the Date: text.

:map <F2> GoDate:<Esc>"=strftime("%c")<CR>pa

The special keys are enclosed in key notation <>. "= is a special register called expression register.
Expression register is special in the sense that you cannot put text in to it. Here "= is typed right after
the escape key and because of the special nature of the expression, vim switches to the command line mode ready 
to accept any expression - in this case our expression is strftime("%c"), a function to retrieve the formatted date and time.
Next enter button instructs vim to execute the previous expression.The p command tells vim to put the just executed expression string and the 
a command moves to the insert mode.

So far so good, you can press <F2> in normal mode and can append the date to the end of the file. But it will not work in insert mode.
 :map, thus maps the key sequences in normal mode. For the above command to work in insert mode you 
have to use :imap.

:imap <F2> <Esc>GoDate:<Esc>"=strftime("%c")<CR>pa

:map key bindings will work in normal, visual, and operator pending mode. An operator character such as d or y in vim expects a motion command after it. 
When you type the operator command and then wait for typing the motion command, you are in operator pending mode, Phew. :map! works in insert and command line modes while 
:vmap, :nmap, :imap, :cmap, and :omap works in visual, normal, insert, command-line, and operator pending modes respectively.
